# Parallel Task Execution Test Report

## Test Date: June 5, 2025

## Test Overview
Tested the new task-based parallel execution architecture (v2.1.0) to verify functionality and identify issues.

## Test Setup
- Created test issue #11 with 6 checklist tasks
- Parsed tasks into queue using github tool
- Attempted to assign tasks to parallel sessions
- Tested branch creation and checkbox updates

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **GitHub Tool - Checklist Parsing**
   - Successfully parsed all 6 checklist items
   - Correctly identified manual task (üë§ prefix)
   - Output format: `NUM|STATUS|DESCRIPTION`

2. **GitHub Tool - Checkbox Updates**
   - `update-checkbox` command works correctly
   - Can check/uncheck individual items
   - `checklist-status` shows accurate progress

3. **Task Tool - Queue Management**
   - Successfully added tasks with #11-1 format
   - Dependency tracking works (blocked-by syntax)
   - Queue listing shows all tasks

4. **Commands Available**
   - All expected commands exist in `/commands/`
   - work-on.md, task-status.md, continue.md present

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Found

1. **Session Tool - Task Detection Broken**
   - Issue: References `is_task` variable but never sets it
   - Impact: Tasks treated as regular issues
   - Result: Wrong branch naming and worktree paths
   - Evidence:
     ```bash
     # Expected: task/#11-1-create-test-file
     # Actual:   feature/#11-1-
     ```

2. **Session Tool - Branch Naming Issues**
   - Creates `feature/` branches instead of `task/`
   - Includes # character in branch name (invalid)
   - Missing task description in branch name
   - Worktree path includes # character

3. **Missing Task Detection Logic**
   - Session tool needs logic to detect #XX-Y format
   - Should parse issue number and task number
   - Should create appropriate task branches

4. **Setup-Autonomous Tool Missing**
   - Error: "No autonomous settings template found"
   - Templates directory doesn't exist
   - settings.worktree.json not found

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The session tool was partially updated but is missing critical task detection logic:

```bash
# Missing code block (should be around line 70):
# Check if this is a task ID format (#XX-Y)
if [[ "$issue" =~ ^#?([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
    is_task=true
    issue_num="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    task_num="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
    # Get task description for branch name
    task_desc=$(grep "^#$issue_num-$task_num|" .claude/tasks/queue.txt | cut -d'|' -f2 | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g')
    branch="task/$issue_num-$task_num-$task_desc"
    worktree_path="$WORKTREE_BASE/task-$issue_num-$task_num"
else
    is_task=false
    # Existing issue logic...
fi
```

### üìã Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix Required**
   - Add task detection logic to session tool
   - Fix branch naming to use `task/` prefix
   - Remove # from branch names and paths
   - Set up proper worktree paths

2. **Additional Fixes**
   - Create templates directory structure
   - Add settings.worktree.json template
   - Update work.md command to use new task queue
   - Test end-to-end workflow after fixes

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Fix session tool first (blocking everything)
   - Re-test with same issue #11
   - Verify branches are created correctly
   - Test PR creation with task references
   - Ensure checkbox updates on PR merge

## Conclusion

The v2.1.0 implementation is **incomplete and not ready for use**. While the bottom layer (github/task tools) works correctly, the critical middle layer (session management) is broken. This prevents the entire parallel task execution workflow from functioning.

**Current State**: ~65% complete (was estimated at 35% in V2.1.0_ANALYSIS_AND_PLAN.md)

**Blocking Issue**: Session tool task detection must be fixed before any parallel task work can proceed.

## Test Artifacts

- Test Issue: #11 (claude-code-parallel repo)
- Task Queue: Contains 6 parsed tasks (#11-1 through #11-6)
- Branches Created: feature/#11-1-, feature/#11-2- (incorrect)
- Worktrees: .worktrees/#11-1, .worktrees/#11-2 (incorrect paths)
