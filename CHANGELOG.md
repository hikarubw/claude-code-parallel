### Initial Public Release

After extracting OAuth features and renaming from `claude-code-tools` to `claude-code-parallel`, this marks the first public release focused on parallel development automation.

### Features
- **Parallel Development** - Work on multiple issues simultaneously
- **Task Queue Management** - File-based queue with dependency tracking
- **tmux Integration** - Parallel sessions with isolated environments
- **Git Worktrees** - Safe isolation for each task
- **GitHub Integration** - Issue breakdown and PR automation
- **Smart Maintenance** - Automatic cleanup of completed work

### Commands
- `/project:setup` - Initialize project for parallel work
- `/project:work N` - Start N parallel sessions
- `/project:status` - View all parallel work status
- `/project:manual` - Handle manual tasks
- `/project:maintain` - Clean up resources
- `/project:auto` - Continuous automation

### Tools
- `task` - Queue and dependency management
- `session` - Parallel tmux/worktree control
- `github` - Issue operations

### Philosophy
Built on "Claude-first" architecture where simple tools (50-200 lines) are orchestrated by Claude's intelligence, not embedded logic.
