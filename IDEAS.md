# Claude Code Parallel - Ideas & Experiments

This file captures ideas for future exploration. These are experiments and concepts, not commitments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recently Implemented (Now in v2.0.0)

### âœ… Autonomous Operation
- **Implemented**: Worktree-specific permissive settings
- **Result**: 90% reduction in approval interruptions
- **Learning**: Isolation + permissions = safe autonomy

### âœ… Intelligent Branch Naming
- **Implemented**: Claude decides feature/, bugfix/, docs/ prefixes
- **Result**: Cleaner branch organization
- **Learning**: Claude's context awareness works well

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas Under Consideration

### Enhanced Manual Work Detection
```bash
# Idea: Background monitoring of GitHub issues
/project:monitor start
# Could detect issue state changes
# Auto-unblock dependent tasks
# No manual marking needed
```

**Why interesting**: Reduces manual overhead, enables true async work

### Service Architecture
```bash
# Idea: Long-running background services
/project:services start
- Issue state monitor
- PR merge detector  
- Test result watcher
- Queue processor
```

**Why interesting**: Move from polling to event-driven architecture

### Distributed Execution
```yaml
# Idea: Work across multiple machines
machines:
  - local: 5 sessions
  - cloud-1: 10 sessions
  - cloud-2: 10 sessions
```

**Why interesting**: Scale beyond single machine limits

## ðŸ”¬ Experimental Concepts

### Learning & Optimization
- Track which issues take longest
- Learn optimal parallelism per project
- Suggest task ordering based on history
- Predict blockers before they happen

### Team Coordination
- Shared work queues across developers
- Automatic conflict detection
- PR review assignments
- Knowledge transfer between sessions

### Advanced Autonomy
- Self-healing from test failures
- Automatic dependency updates
- Smart refactoring detection
- Cross-PR coordination

## ðŸš« Ideas We've Rejected (And Why)

### Complex State Management
- **Idea**: SQLite database for state
- **Rejected because**: File-based is simpler and sufficient
- **Learning**: Complexity isn't worth it until 20+ sessions

### Embedded Intelligence
- **Idea**: Smart tools that make decisions
- **Rejected because**: Violates Claude-first principle
- **Learning**: Keep tools dumb, Claude smart

### Automatic Commits
- **Idea**: Commit after every change
- **Rejected because**: Creates noisy history
- **Learning**: Let Claude decide commit boundaries

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Criteria

Before implementing any idea:
1. **Does it keep tools simple?** (<200 lines)
2. **Does it solve a real user pain?**
3. **Can Claude orchestrate it intelligently?**
4. **Does it maintain safety?**
5. **Is the complexity justified?**

## ðŸ§ª How to Experiment

Want to try an idea?

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a prototype tool
3. Test with real workflows
4. Share results in issues
5. If valuable, we'll consider inclusion

Remember: The best ideas come from real usage, not speculation.

## ðŸš€ Long-Term Architecture Concepts

### Task-Based Architecture (v2.1.0 - Next Release)
- GitHub issue checklists as work units
- Each checkbox = parallel task
- Visual progress tracking
- **Status**: Planned for implementation (3 weeks)

### Intent-Directed Development
- Code that understands business goals, not just syntax
- Prioritize by value, not volume
- Example: Fix the bug causing 80% of complaints first

### Predictive Development  
- Anticipate issues before they happen
- Pre-scale before traffic spikes
- Fix bugs before users find them

### Multi-Agent Consciousness
- Multiple specialized agents working as one
- Architect + Developer + Reviewer perspectives
- Holistic decision making

**Evolution path**: Human-directed â†’ Code-directed â†’ Purpose-directed

## ðŸ’­ Wild Ideas (Sky's the Limit)

- Voice control for commands
- AR/VR visualization of parallel work
- AI pair programming in each session
- Automatic code review before PR
- Dream-driven development (work while you sleep?)

These are fun to think about but far from current focus!
