# Task-Based Development Status Dashboard

Get a comprehensive view of your parallel task development progress.

Usage: /project:status [what]

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Screenshot Support
ðŸ“¸ **Claude Code Tip**: Take a screenshot of your terminal showing the status output and paste it directly into Claude Code. I can analyze the visual output to:
- Identify stuck or idle sessions
- Spot patterns in blocked tasks
- Suggest optimizations based on visual cues
- Debug issues with parallel execution

**How to use**: Simply paste a screenshot after running this command for visual analysis.

## Dashboard Sections

### Overview
- Active sessions and their task assignments
- Task queue status by issue
- Manual tasks blocking automation
- Recent task completions
- Issue progress (checklist completion)

### Detailed Views
I'll parse arguments for specific views:
- `sessions` - Detailed session information
- `tasks` - Task queue and dependencies
- `issues` - Issue-level progress
- `manual` - Manual work focus
- `activity` - Recent activity log
- Default: Full dashboard

## Key Indicators
- âš¡ Task in progress
- âœ“ Task completed
- â—¯ Task pending
- ðŸ‘¤ Manual task

## Quick Actions
Based on status, I might suggest:
- Complete manual tasks to unblock work
- Focus on nearly-complete issues
- Review task dependencies
- Clean up completed worktrees

## Auto-Refresh
This command can be run repeatedly to monitor progress:
```bash
watch -n 60 'claude /project:status'
```

## Visual Debugging with Screenshots
When troubleshooting parallel execution issues:
1. Run `/project:status` to see current state
2. Take a screenshot of the output
3. Paste it into Claude Code with your question
4. I can visually analyze:
   - Session states and durations
   - Queue backlogs
   - Blocking patterns
   - Resource usage trends
