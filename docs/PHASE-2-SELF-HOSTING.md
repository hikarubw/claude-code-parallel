# Phase 2: Self-Hosted Development with Claude Code Parallel

## Can Claude Code Parallel build Pueue-TUI? YES! ðŸš€

This is the perfect test case - using the tool to build its own successor.

## How It Would Work

### 1. Create Parent Issues
```bash
# Create GitHub issues for Phase 2
gh issue create --title "Week 2: Extract and build Pueue-TUI core" \
  --body "Extract visualization logic into standalone tool"

gh issue create --title "Week 3: Polish and launch Pueue-TUI" \
  --body "Package, document, and launch to community"
```

### 2. Start Claude Code Parallel
```bash
# Assuming issues #40 and #41 were created
./start-parallel.sh work 40,41 6
```

### 3. Claude Would Decompose Into Subissues

**Issue #40** â†’ Subissues:
- #401: Create Pueue-TUI repository structure
- #402: Extract core visualization logic
- #403: Implement Pueue backend adapter
- #404: Create CLI interface
- #405: Build worker management system
- #406: Create test suite

**Issue #41** â†’ Subissues:
- #411: Write documentation and examples
- #412: Package for NPM
- #413: Create demo videos
- #414: Write blog post
- #415: Submit to communities

### 4. Parallel Development
- 6 Claude workers processing subissues simultaneously
- Each creates PRs automatically
- Visual monitoring via tmux

## Benefits of Self-Hosting Development

1. **Dogfooding** - Prove the tool works by using it
2. **Parallel Speed** - 6x faster than sequential development
3. **Quality** - Each piece reviewed via PR
4. **Demonstration** - Show real-world usage

## Practical Considerations

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Create new repo for Pueue-TUI
gh repo create pueue-tui --public --description "Terminal UI for Pueue"
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/[username]/pueue-tui
cd pueue-tui

# Copy Claude Code Parallel tools
cp -r ../claude-code-parallel/.claude .
cp ../claude-code-parallel/start-parallel.sh .
```

### Issue Templates
Create detailed issues with clear requirements:

```markdown
# Issue: Create Pueue-TUI repository structure

## Requirements
- TypeScript/Node.js project
- Modular architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- MIT license

## Directory Structure
```
pueue-tui/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backends/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository initialized
- [ ] Build system configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline ready
- [ ] README with vision
```

### Worker Allocation
```bash
# Start with 6 workers for Phase 2
./start-parallel.sh work 40,41 6

# Workers 1-3: Week 2 tasks (core development)
# Workers 4-6: Week 3 tasks (launch preparation)
```

## Expected Timeline

Using Claude Code Parallel:
- **Week 2 tasks**: 2-3 days (instead of 5-7 days)
- **Week 3 tasks**: 2-3 days (instead of 5-7 days)
- **Total**: ~1 week instead of 2 weeks

## Commands to Start

```bash
# 1. Create the Week 2 and Week 3 issues in GitHub
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."

# 2. Start parallel development
./start-parallel.sh work ISSUE_NUMBERS 6

# 3. Monitor progress
tmux attach -t claude-workers

# 4. Review and merge PRs as they come in
gh pr list
```

## Why This Is Perfect

1. **Real Project** - Not a toy example
2. **Complex Enough** - Tests coordination capabilities
3. **Valuable Output** - Creates useful tool for community
4. **Full Lifecycle** - From creation to launch
5. **Proves the Concept** - Shows the tool's power

The ultimate validation: Claude Code Parallel building tools that make development more efficient!
