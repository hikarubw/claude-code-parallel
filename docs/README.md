## 💡 Key Concepts

### Parallel Development
Run multiple Claude instances working on different issues simultaneously, each in an isolated git worktree.

### Autonomous Operation
With permissive settings in isolated worktrees, Claude can work without constant approval requests.

### Simple Tools
Each tool does one thing well (~50-200 lines). Claude provides the intelligence.

### Natural Workflows
Works with your existing GitHub workflow. No new concepts to learn.

## 📁 Archive

The `archive/` directory contains historical proposals and research documents that informed the current design but are not part of the active documentation.
