## Security Considerations

These tools execute bash commands and interact with your development environment. Always:
- Review the code before running
- Understand what permissions you're granting
- Use in trusted environments only

## Not for Production

This is an experimental tool for development assistance, not for production use.

If you find it useful, great! But please understand it's a personal tool shared as-is.
