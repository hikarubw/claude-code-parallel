# Claude Code Parallel - Development Roadmap

## Current State (v2.0.0)
- ✅ Core parallel execution with tmux/worktrees
- ✅ Task queue with dependency management
- ✅ GitHub integration for issue breakdown
- ✅ **Autonomous operation** with 90% fewer interruptions
- ✅ Intelligent branch naming (feature/, bugfix/, docs/)
- ✅ Worktree-specific permissive settings
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with guides and FAQ

## Philosophy
- **Simple tools**: Each tool stays under 200 lines
- **Claude provides intelligence**: Tools are "hands", not "brains"
- **Natural workflows**: Work with existing tools and conventions
- **Safe autonomy**: Freedom within isolated worktrees

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Every feature must justify complexity
2. **Claude Intelligence**: Let Claude handle the "why" and "how"
3. **User Safety**: Autonomous but always reviewable
4. **Real Usage**: Features driven by actual needs
