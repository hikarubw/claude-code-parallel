# Claude Code Tools - Development Roadmap

## Current State (v0.3.0-experimental)
- âœ… **Subissue-Based Worker Pool Architecture**
- âœ… Intelligent issue analysis with Claude
- âœ… Priority queue management
- âœ… Autonomous worker sessions
- âœ… Automatic PR creation
- âœ… Resume capability
- âœ… 99% autonomous operation

## Philosophy
- **Simple interface**: One command to start everything
- **Claude intelligence**: AI analyzes and decomposes work
- **Natural GitHub flow**: Issues â†’ Subissues â†’ PRs
- **Zero configuration**: Just provide issue numbers

## Architecture Evolution

### v1.0 (Original)
- Issue-based parallelism
- Manual orchestration
- Limited scalability

### v2.0 (Task-Based) - Archived
- Checklist items as tasks
- Complex ID system (#47-1)
- Manual task creation

### v0.3.0 (Current) - Subissue-Based (Experimental)
- Automatic issue decomposition
- Worker pool pattern
- Priority queue system
- Fully autonomous
