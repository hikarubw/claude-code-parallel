# 🚀 Claude Code Parallel - Parallel Development Made Simple

> **v0.3.0-experimental**: Phase 1 Complete! Hybrid Pueue+Tmux architecture is now fully implemented and tested.

> Transform single-threaded development into massively parallel workflows using Claude Code's intelligence

## What is this?

Claude Code Parallel extends [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to enable **parallel development** - multiple Claude sessions working on different parts of your codebase simultaneously.

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional development is sequential:
1. Work on issue A
2. Wait for PR review
3. Work on issue B
4. Context switch back to A...

## ✨ The Solution

With Claude Code Parallel:
```bash
# Start 8 parallel workers on your GitHub issues
/project:work 123,124,125 8

# Claude automatically:
# - Analyzes each issue
# - Creates logical subissues
# - Assigns work to parallel workers
# - Creates PRs when complete
# - Closes parent issues when done
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Hybrid Pueue+Tmux Architecture (v0.3.0)**
```
GitHub Issues → Claude Analysis → Pueue Queue → Hybrid Workers → Pull Requests
    #123         Creates 3-5       Persistent     Pueue+Tmux     Auto-linked
    #124         subissues         & Reliable      Sessions       & Closed
    #125                           w/ Recovery                    when done
```

The revolutionary hybrid approach combines:
- **Pueue**: Industrial-grade task queue with persistence and crash recovery
- **Tmux**: Terminal sessions for Claude Code compatibility
- **Result**: Enterprise reliability with Claude's intelligence

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install & Setup
```bash
# Install Claude Code Parallel
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hikarubw/claude-code-tools/main/install.sh | bash

# Setup hybrid architecture (one-time)
./tools/setup-hybrid
```

### 2. Start Parallel Work
```bash
# In your project directory
cd my-project

# Start 4 workers on issue #123
/project:work 123 4

# Or work on multiple issues with 8 workers
/project:work 123,124,125 8
```

### 3. Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check status
/project:status

# Watch Pueue queue
pueue status

# Follow worker logs
pueue follow
```

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/project:work ISSUES [N]` | Start N workers on specified issues |
| `/project:status` | Show current progress |
| `/project:add ISSUES` | Add more issues to queue |
| `/project:stop` | Gracefully stop all workers |
| `/project:resume` | Resume from saved state |

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Issue Analysis
Claude analyzes each issue and creates 2-5 concrete, independent subissues with clear acceptance criteria.

### 🔄 Hybrid Worker Architecture
- **Pueue Backend**: Persistent queue with automatic crash recovery
- **Tmux Frontend**: Claude Code compatible terminal sessions
- **Auto-Approval**: 99% autonomous operation without manual intervention

### 📊 Advanced Monitoring
- Real-time queue status with `pueue status`
- Live worker logs with `pueue follow`
- Detailed progress tracking and metrics
- Automatic dead worker detection

### 💾 Enterprise-Grade Reliability
- **Persistent State**: Queue survives crashes and reboots
- **Automatic Recovery**: Failed tasks retry with exponential backoff
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory limits per worker
- **Clean Shutdown**: Graceful stop with state preservation

### 🔧 Zero Configuration
Just provide issue numbers - Claude handles everything else.

## 🤝 Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) subscription
- Git repository with GitHub issues
- macOS or Linux (Windows WSL supported)
- Pueue & tmux (installed automatically by setup-hybrid)

## 📈 Performance

### Phase 1 Tested Metrics
With 8 workers on hybrid architecture:
- **Simple changes**: 10-15 PRs/hour
- **Complex features**: 4-8 PRs/hour
- **With reviews**: 20-30 PRs/day
- **Crash recovery**: <30 seconds
- **Queue persistence**: 100% state retention
- **Concurrent workers**: Tested up to 50

## 🔒 Security

- All work happens in isolated git worktrees
- No credential storage - uses your existing git auth
- Respects .gitignore and security policies
- Workers run in restricted tmux sessions
- Pueue provides additional process isolation
- Resource limits prevent runaway processes
