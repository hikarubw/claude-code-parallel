# Initialize Project for Parallel Development

Prepare your project for intelligent parallel development with Claude.

Usage: /project:setup

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## What I'll Do

### 1. Analyze Codebase Structure
- Scan all source files to understand architecture
- Read configuration files (package.json, etc.)
- Map module organization and dependencies
- Identify test patterns and CI/CD setup

### 2. Fetch and Analyze GitHub Issues
- Get all open issues with full details
- If no issues exist, help create initial task breakdown
- Analyze issue descriptions and checklists

### 3. Complexity Assessment
- Estimate work required for each issue
- Identify issues needing breakdown (>4 hours)
- Detect dependencies between issues
- Assess risk levels (UI, logic, data, security)

### 4. Create/Update Issues
- Break complex issues into sub-tasks using `github split`
- Add appropriate labels:
  - `claude-work` for automated tasks
  - `manual-work` for human tasks (prefix with ðŸ‘¤)
  - Size labels: `size-xs` (<1hr), `size-s` (1-2hr), `size-m` (2-4hr)
- Track dependencies with `task block`

### 5. Prepare Work Queue
- Add all ready issues to queue with `task add`
- Prioritize based on dependencies
- Separate manual vs automated work
- Set up blocking relationships

## Example Output
```
Analyzing codebase...
âœ“ Found TypeScript project with 127 files
âœ“ Detected Jest tests and GitHub Actions CI

Fetching GitHub issues...
âœ“ Found 47 open issues

Breaking down complex issues...
âœ“ Created 23 sub-issues for large tasks
âœ“ Added size labels to all issues

Identifying dependencies...
âœ“ Found 8 blocking relationships
âœ“ 5 manual tasks block automated work

Preparing work queue...
âœ“ Added 35 automated tasks to queue
âœ“ Prioritized based on dependencies

Setup complete! Ready for parallel execution.
- Total tasks: 47 (12 manual, 35 automated)
- Blocked tasks: 8 (waiting on manual work)
- Ready to start: 27

Run /project:work to begin parallel development!
```

## Next Steps
After setup completes:
1. Review manual tasks with `/project:manual`
2. Start parallel work with `/project:work`
3. Monitor progress with `/project:status`
