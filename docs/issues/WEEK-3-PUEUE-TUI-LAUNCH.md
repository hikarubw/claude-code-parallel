Title: Introducing Pueue-TUI - Terminal UI for Pueue

Hi Pueue community! ðŸ‘‹

I've created Pueue-TUI, a terminal UI that makes Pueue queues visible in tmux. 
It's designed for developers who need to see what their queue workers are doing in real-time.

Features:
- See all workers and their current tasks
- Monitor queue status in real-time  
- Auto-restart failed workers
- Zero configuration required

Install: npm install -g pueue-tui
Repo: github.com/[username]/pueue-tui

Would love your feedback!
```

- [ ] Choose optimal posting time
- [ ] Submit to Hacker News
- [ ] Actively respond to comments

### Show HN Template
```
Title: Show HN: Pueue-TUI â€“ See what your task queue is doing in the terminal

Hey HN! I built Pueue-TUI to solve a problem I kept having: debugging 
distributed task queues at 3am without visibility into what's happening.

It creates a tmux session that shows all your Pueue workers and their 
current tasks in real-time. Think of it as 'htop for task queues'.

Why I built this:
- Debugging invisible background workers is painful
- Logs are scattered across multiple files
- Need to see the whole system at a glance

Quick start:
$ npm install -g pueue-tui
$ pueue-tui

GitHub: [link]
Demo GIF: [link]

Would love feedback on the UX and what backends to support next!
```
