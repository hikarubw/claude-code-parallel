# Master Plan & Roadmap: Claude Code Parallel + Pueue-TUI

## Vision Statement
Transform AI-powered development through visible, parallel task execution. Make the invisible visible.

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Validation âœ… (DONE)
- Hybrid architecture proven (ADR-003)
- Pueue-TUI prototype working

- Better user experience

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Building (Months 3-6)
**Goal**: Build integrations and community

#### Core Integrations
- [ ] GitHub Actions: `anthropics/pueue-tui-action`
- [ ] VSCode Extension: "Pueue-TUI Task Runner"
- [ ] Docker image: `pueue-tui/pueue-tui`
- [ ] Kubernetes operator

#### Language SDKs
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript (first)
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust

#### Community Building
- [ ] Pueue-TUI Hub for sharing patterns
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Conference talks
- [ ] Corporate sponsors

### Phase 6: Intelligence Layer (Months 6-12)
**Goal**: Add AI-powered features

#### Smart Scheduling
- [ ] Learn from execution history
- [ ] Predict task duration
- [ ] Optimize parallelization
- [ ] Failure prediction

#### Natural Language
- [ ] "pueue-tui ai 'build my project'"
- [ ] Conversational task creation
- [ ] Error explanation

#### Recording & Replay
- [ ] Full session recording
- [ ] Shareable recordings
- [ ] AI analysis of recordings

## Technical Roadmap

### Immediate (Week 1)
```bash
# Fix these specific issues:
1. setup-hybrid script error handling
2. queue-pueue sync reliability  
3. worker session management
4. Auto-approval integration
```

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
```typescript
// Pueue-TUI core architecture
interface Pueue-TUICore {
  queue: PueueAdapter;
  visualizer: TmuxManager;
  monitor: DashboardEngine;
  recorder: SessionRecorder;
}
```

### Medium-term (Weeks 5-8)
```yaml
# Pueue-TUI patterns library
patterns:
  - name: parallel-tests
    file: patterns/testing.yaml
  - name: ci-pipeline  
    file: patterns/ci.yaml
  - name: ai-agents
    file: patterns/ai.yaml
```

### Long-term (Months 3-12)
```javascript
// Distributed architecture
class Pueue-TUICluster {
  master: Pueue-TUIMaster;
  workers: Pueue-TUIWorker[];
  
  async scaleAcrossMachines() {}
  async balanceLoad() {}
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Pueue API changes | High | Pin versions, maintain compatibility layer |
| Tmux limitations | Medium | Implement fallback modes |
| Performance issues | Medium | Profiling, optimization passes |

### Adoption Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Learning curve | High | Excellent docs, videos, examples |
| Competition | Medium | Move fast, build community |
| Enterprise needs | Low | Add features based on feedback |

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- 1 full-time developer (6 months)
- Design help for docs/branding
- Community manager (part-time)

### Infrastructure
- GitHub organization
- NPM organization
- Domain: pueue-tui.dev
- Documentation hosting
- CI/CD pipeline

## Decision Points

### Week 2: Go/No-Go on Extraction
- Is hybrid architecture stable?
- Is there community interest?
- Do we have resources?

### Week 6: Open Source Strategy
- License choice (MIT likely)
- Governance model
- Contribution guidelines

### Month 3: Monetization
- Keep fully open source?
- Open core model?
- Support contracts?

## The North Star

Every decision should be guided by:
1. **Does it make tasks more visible?**
2. **Does it help developers understand what's happening?**
3. **Does it simplify AI agent development?**

## Call to Action

### This Week
1. Fix setup-hybrid script
2. Complete Pueue migration
3. Polish hybrid-worker

### Next Week
1. Start Pueue-TUI extraction
2. Create GitHub repository
3. Build community interest

### This Month
1. Launch Pueue-TUI v0.1
2. Get first users
3. Iterate based on feedback

## The Dream Realized

**Year 1**: Pueue-TUI becomes the standard Pueue visualizer
**Year 2**: Every AI developer uses it for agent visibility  
**Year 3**: It's a fundamental tool like tmux itself
