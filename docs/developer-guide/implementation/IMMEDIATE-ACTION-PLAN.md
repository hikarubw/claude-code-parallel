# Immediate Action Plan: Next 48 Hours

## The Ultrathinking Bottom Line

**Focus**: Make what we have work flawlessly before building more.

## TODAY: Fix Critical Issues (Next 6 Hours)

### Hour 1-2: Fix setup-hybrid
```bash
# Problem: Script exits on queue-pueue init error
# Solution: Make initialization idempotent

# Fix in setup-hybrid:
- ~/Documents/repo/claude-code-parallel/tools/queue-pueue init || true

# Better:
if ! pueue group | grep -q "subissues"; then
    pueue group add subissues
fi
```

### Hour 3-4: Fix Worker Creation
```bash
# Problem: Grid manager has pane targeting issues
# Solution: Simplify to sequential creation

# Instead of complex grid management:
for i in 1 2 3 4; do
    tmux new-window -t claude-workers -n "worker-$i"
    tmux send-keys -t claude-workers:worker-$i "./tools/hybrid-worker $i" C-m
done
```

### Hour 5-6: Test End-to-End
```bash
# Clean slate test:
./tools/clean-all  # Create this
./tools/setup-hybrid 4
./tools/analyze 123  # Use a real issue
# Watch it work perfectly
```

## TOMORROW: Polish Core Flow (Day 2)

### Morning: Create 'clean-all' Tool
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tools/clean-all - Reset everything for testing
tmux kill-server 2>/dev/null || true
pueue reset -f 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf ~/.claude/queue/
rm -rf .worktrees/
git worktree prune
echo "✅ Clean slate ready"
```

### Afternoon: Create Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash  
# tools/health-check - Is everything working?
echo "Checking system health..."

# Check Pueue
pueue status &>/dev/null || echo "❌ Pueue not running"

# Check workers
tmux list-sessions | grep -q claude-workers || echo "❌ No workers"

# Check queue
pueue status --json | jq '.tasks | length' || echo "❌ Queue error"

echo "✅ System healthy"
```

### Evening: Record Demo Video
- Show setup from scratch
- Add real GitHub issue
- Watch Claude work in parallel
- Show monitoring dashboard

## The 48-Hour Deliverable

**One Command That Always Works:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-tools
cd claude-code-parallel
./install.sh
./tools/setup-hybrid 4
/project:work #123 #124 #125
# Watch the magic happen
```

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- ❌ NOT extracting Pueue-TUI yet
- ❌ NOT adding new features
- ❌ NOT optimizing performance
- ❌ NOT writing extensive docs
- ❌ NOT promoting publicly

**Just making it WORK reliably.**

## Success Criteria (48 Hours)

### Must Have
- [ ] setup-hybrid works 10/10 times
- [ ] Workers process real issues
- [ ] Monitor shows accurate status
- [ ] No file queue usage

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Demo video recorded
- [ ] Basic troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Clean-all utility
- [ ] Health check tool

### Don't Need Yet
- Perfect code structure
- 100% test coverage
- Beautiful UI
- Advanced features

## The Debugging Mindset

When something fails, ask:
1. Is Pueue running? (`pueue status`)
2. Are workers alive? (`tmux list-sessions`)
3. What's in queue? (`pueue status --json | jq`)
4. What do logs say? (`tmux capture-pane -t claude-workers:0`)

## Commit Messages (Keep Simple)

```bash
git commit -m "fix: setup-hybrid error handling"
git commit -m "fix: worker session creation"
git commit -m "feat: add clean-all utility"
git commit -m "fix: monitor pane updates"
```

## The One Metric

**Can a new user clone and run in < 5 minutes?**

If YES → Ship it
If NO → Fix it

## After 48 Hours

If everything works:
→ Start Pueue-TUI extraction (Week 2)

If still buggy:
→ Continue fixing (don't rush)

If majorly broken:
→ Reassess architecture (unlikely)

## The Mindset

**"Make it work, make it right, make it fast"**

We're in phase 1: Make it work.

No premature optimization.
No feature creep.
No architecture astronauting.

Just. Make. It. Work.
