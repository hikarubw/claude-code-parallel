# Claude Code Parallel - Development Roadmap

## Current State (v2.0.0)
- âœ… Core parallel execution with tmux/worktrees
- âœ… Task queue with dependency management
- âœ… GitHub integration for issue breakdown
- âœ… **Autonomous operation** with 90% fewer interruptions
- âœ… Intelligent branch naming (feature/, bugfix/, docs/)
- âœ… Worktree-specific permissive settings
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation with guides and FAQ

## Philosophy
- **Simple tools**: Each tool stays under 200 lines
- **Claude provides intelligence**: Tools are "hands", not "brains"
- **Natural workflows**: Work with existing tools and conventions
- **Safe autonomy**: Freedom within isolated worktrees

## Future Directions

### Near Term (v2.1.0) - Task-Based Architecture + Claude Code Enhancements
- **Transform to Task-Based Parallelism**
  - GitHub issue checklists as work units
  - Each checkbox = parallel task
  - Visual progress tracking
  - Timeline: 3 weeks (~40 hours)
  
- **Core Tool Updates**
  - `github`: Parse and update checklists
  - `task`: New format (#47-1 instead of #47)
  - `session`: Task-specific branches
  
- **New Commands**
  - `/project:setup-tasks`: Convert issue to tasks
  - `/project:work-on #47-1`: Start specific task
  - `/project:task-status`: Cross-issue task view
  
- **Claude Code Integration Enhancements** ðŸ†•
  - **Extended Thinking**: Add prompts for complex task planning
  - **Continue Command**: `/project:continue [session-id]` to resume sessions
  - **Screenshot Support**: Document visual debugging workflows
  - **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling with visual aids

- **Session Management Improvements** ðŸ†•
  - **Multi-pane Sessions**: Use tmux panes instead of separate sessions
  - **Single Session Architecture**: One tmux session with multiple panes
  - **Benefits**: Better resource usage, easier monitoring, simpler management
  - **Implementation**: Each task gets a pane within claude-parallel session

### Medium Term (v2.2.0)
- **Task Automation**
  - Auto-update checklists on PR merge
  - Smart task dependency resolution
  - Bulk task operations
  
- **Performance & Scale**
  - Session pooling for instant starts
  - Handle 20+ parallel tasks
  - Resource optimization
  
- **Claude Code Advanced Features** ðŸ†•
  - **MCP Integration**: Detect and use available MCP tools
  - **Project Memory**: Auto-generate CLAUDE.md for each project
  - **Version Detection**: Ensure Claude Code compatibility
  - **Image Workflows**: Process architecture diagrams and UI mockups

### Long Term (v3.0.0)
- **Advanced Architectures**
  - Dependency Graph: Auto-discover work from code
  - Intent-Directed: Focus on business value
  - See ARCHITECTURE_MEMO.md for details
  
- **Team Coordination**
  - Multi-Claude collaboration
  - Shared task queues
  - Conflict prevention

## Recently Completed (v2.0.0)

### âœ… Autonomous Operation
- Worktree isolation enables freedom
- Permissive settings in worktrees
- Maintained safety through PR gateway

### âœ… Claude Code Architecture Alignment (Code Review)
- Perfect slash command implementation
- Proper `$ARGUMENTS` usage throughout
- Follows "simple tools + intelligent orchestration"
- Architecture score: 95/100

### âœ… Intelligent Branch Management
- Claude decides branch names based on content
- Not all issues need branches
- Clean branch naming conventions

### âœ… Documentation Overhaul
- Quick Start guide for newcomers
- FAQ for common questions
- Architecture deep dive
- Complete documentation index

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Every feature must justify complexity
2. **Claude Intelligence**: Let Claude handle the "why" and "how"
3. **User Safety**: Autonomous but always reviewable
4. **Real Usage**: Features driven by actual needs
